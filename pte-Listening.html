              <p>One seminal difference in policy remains; the <input type="text"/> has not matched what is Labor's most important innovation promise. That is to bring together responsibilities for innovation, industry, science and research under one single federal minister. Innovation responsibilities <input type="text"/> lie within the powerful Department of Education and Science, and while there is a <input type="text"/> industry department, it has little influence within Cabinet. This has <input type="text"/> policy development and given Australia's  innovation policies a distinctly science and research <input type="text"/> It is the scientists rather than the engineers who call the tune in innovation policy in Canberra, so it's no surprise our policies are all about <input type="text"/> government funded research and later <input type="text"/> their results.</p>

              <p>So far in our discussion of chemical equations we have assumed that these reactions only go in one direction, the forward direction, from left to right as we read it in the equation. That's why our arrowhead points from left to right: reactants react together to make products. However, this is not exactly how things occur in reality. In fact, practically every chemical reaction is reversible, meaning the products can also react together to reform the reactants that they were made of. So instead of writing that single arrow facing from right to top, a more appropriate symbol would be a double arrow, one going from left to right and one going from right to left. Reactants are continually continuously reacting to form produce. But at the same time as those products are formed, they remake the reactants. They're both going simultaneously, forming each other. This is what we would call a state of equality.</p>

              <p>I think the importance of creativity today really reflects a fundamental rift in the nature of the economy. You know, in the old days, wealth was created because in the industrial era, you manufactured everything, you got economies of scale, you had long production runs, you were really effective you know, you could get a Model T, any color just so long as it was black. Right? So there was centralization. And there was a whole set of presumptions about how to manage, how to create an organization - you know, a typical kind of hierarchical organization to make sure that things ran smoothly. Well, that may be great for a relatively stable era of history relatively stable but now things are functionally unstable and so we need less economies of scale and more economies of recovery. Which means that the management approach, the organizational approach, has got to shift as well.</p>
