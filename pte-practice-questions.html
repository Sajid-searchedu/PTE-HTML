                    <p> The  Classic  Era  of  Mayan  came  to  an  end  around  900  AD.  Why  this  happened  is  unclear;  the  cities  were  probably  over-farming  the  land,  so  that  a  period  of  drought  led  to  famine.  Recent  geological  research  supports  this,  as  there  appears  to  have  been  a  200-year  drought  around  this  time. </p>

                    <h6><b>Depression Symptoms</b></h6>
                    <p>Symptoms  of  depression  decrease  with  improvements  in  sense  of  smell,  particularly  among  patients  with  dyssomnia.  New  research  published  in  the  journal  Scientific  Reports  highlights  the  intricate  relationship  between  depression  and  sense  of  smell.  The  study  found  that  participants’  symptoms  of  depression  dropped  as  their  odor  identification  improved,  particularly  among  those  with  an  impaired  sense  of  smell. </p>

                    <p>The  noise  restrictions  are  based  on  measurements  on  animals  in  captivity  exposed  to  noise  levels  that  induce  a  temporary  threshold  shift  (TTS)  in  hearing.  The  TTS  onset  threshold  is  the  lowest  noise  exposure  capable  of  inducing  a  small  temporary  reduction  of  hearing  sensitivity,  also  known  as  auditory  fatigue,  with  full  recovery  shortly  after  exposure.  </p>

                    <p>In  the  past  naming  English  as  a  separate  subject  seemed  relatively  easy.

New  items  were  carefully  controlled  so  that  the  student  could  cope  quite  easily.  Now  that  English  is  used  as  a  medium  of  instruction,  however,  all  this  has  changed.  Unknown  items  of  grammar  and  vocabulary  appear  in  texts  which  attempt  to  explain  new  and  often  difficult  information.   </p>

                      <h6><b>Stars</b></h6>
                      <p>Since the dawn of recorded civilization, stars played a key role in religion and proved vital to navigation, according to the International Astronomical Union. Astronomy, the study of the heavens, may be the most ancient of the sciences. The invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century prompted the realization that stars were just like the sun, all obeying the same laws of physics. In the 19th century, photography and spectroscopy - the study of the wavelengths of light that objects emit - made it possible to investigate the compositions and motions of stars from afar, leading to the development of astrophysics. A star develops from a giant, slowly rotating cloud that is made up entirely or almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. Due to its own gravitational pull, the cloud behind to collapse inward, and as it shrinks, it spins more and more quickly, with the outer parts becoming a disk while the innermost parts become a roughly spherical clump. According to NASA, this collapsing material grows hotter and denser, forming a ball-shaped protostar. When the heat and pressure in the protostar reaches about 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit, atomic nuclei that normally repel each other start fusing together, and the star ignites. Nuclear fusion converts a small amount of the mass of these atoms into extraordinary amounts of energy - for instance, 1 gram of mass converted entirely to energy would be equal to an explosion of roughly 22,000 tons of TNT. The life cycles of stars follow patterns based mostly on their initial mass. These include intermediate-mass stars such as the sun, with half to eight times the mass of the sun, high-mass stars that are more than eight solar masses, and low-mass stars a tenth to half a solar mass in size. The greater a star's mass, the shorter its lifespan generally is, according to NASA. Objects smaller than a tenth of a solar mass do not have enough gravitational pull to ignite nuclear fusion - some might become failed stars known as brown dwarfs.</p>

                         <h6><b>Forensic Anthropology</b></h6>  
                         <p>There are a number of applications of anthropology to the forensic sciences. A large part of physical anthropology deals with skeletal biology, which includes bone and bone system structures and their relationships to characteristics such as gender, age, race, socioeconomic status, and so forth. That knowledge can be applied to the examination of characteristics of skeletal remains that are part of a crime scene. In such cases, the goal of the analysis may be to determine the identity of the deceased person and, perhaps, the cause of death. To those ends, forensic anthropologists make use of a number of unique techniques. Two major types of human-remains evidence confront the forensic anthropologist. First is the single bone or bone fragment or small group of bones. When that is the only type of evidence present, the forensic anthropologist seeks to determine if the bone is human and, if not, what type of animal the bone belongs to. If the sample is human bone, then the anthropologist will determine the part of the body from which it came. The second major type of forensic anthropological evidence is the complete skeleton. From that evidence, the accomplished forensic anthropologist may be able to determine gender, race, approximate age, stature, and approximate socioeconomic status. If there is damage to some of the bones, the anthropologist may be able to determine what type of trauma caused it. If the skull is present, it may be possible to prepare an approximate face on the skull using skull superimposition. Investigators may then publish a picture of the face to see if it evokes a response from a relative of a missing person.</p>

                         <h6><b>Locust Management</b></h6>  
                         <p>There's a slate of international institutions that coordinates locust management and response. The primary effort is conducted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which runs the Desert Locust Watch to track locust migration patterns and oversee regional response efforts. In individual nations, a lack of cash, competing priorities and domestic challenges make it hard to mount a long-range pest management strategy. Because locust numbers ebb and flow, it's been difficult for countries - such as Kenya, which hasn't seen an infestation in 70 years - to build up intermediate and long-term infrastructure to address outbreaks proactively. That's why so many governments are now scrambling to come up with solutions. “It's hard to maintain funding and political will and knowledge and capacity building when you have these unpredictable boom and bust cycles that could play out over years or decades," a pest expert Overson says. “If you wait until it's reactive and forget about it until it happens again, we're going to be in this situation forever." Right now, the most effective way to fight locust outbreaks involves mass aerial sprays of pesticides to kill locusts. Overson says that's not ideal, given the adverse effect such chemicals have on biodiversity and human health. But emerging technologies may hold promise for the future. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently partnered with the United Nations to repurpose technology used to track smoke plumes from fires to predict the migrations of locusts, the Scientific American reported. And in terms of locust extermination, Overson says biopesticides have untapped potential - although lots of research and development is still needed in the area.</p>

                         <p>Oxygen can be found in many of the minerals in the ground around us, and the Moon is mostly made of the same rocks you'll find on Earth (although with a slightly greater amount of material that came from meteors). Minerals such as silica, aluminium, and iron and magnesium oxides dominate the Moon's landscape. All of these minerals contain oxygen, but not in a form our lungs can access. The Moon's regolith is made up of approximately 45% oxygen. But that oxygen is tightly bound into the minerals mentioned above. In order to break apart those strong bonds, we need to put in energy. You might be familiar with this if you know about electrolysis. On Earth this process is commonly used in manufacturing, such as to produce aluminium. An electrical current is passed through a liquid form of aluminium oxide (commonly called alumina) via electrodes, to separate the aluminium from the oxygen. In this case, the oxygen is produced as a byproduct. On the Moon, the oxygen would be the main product and the aluminium (or other metal) extracted would be a potentially useful byproduct. It's a pretty straightforward process, but there is a catch: it’s very energy hungry. To be sustainable, it would need to be supported by solar energy or other energy sources available on the Moon. Extracting oxygen from regolith would also require substantial industrial equipment. We'd need to first convert solid metal oxide into liquid form, either by applying heat, or heat combined with solvents or electrolytes. We have the technology to do this on Earth, but moving this apparatus to the Moon - and generating enough energy to run it - will be a mighty challenge.

                         <p>Traveling solo is for many still a scary concept. However, the benefits to traveling by yourself are numerous. You make your own plans, eat whatever you want, stay longer or leave sooner, talk to the people you like, etc. But there is more: traveling solo can have a positive impact on your personality as well. You can grow as a person, learn more about yourself and return a happier person. Traveling alone means having the ultimate freedom to do whatever you want (within the boundaries of the law of course). Who has never had an argument with his/her traveling partner because you have different opinions on how to fill in your travel itinerary? Traveling solo means doing whatever you want, whether you want to plan everything out or set out spontaneously. Go find yourself’, we have all heard the cliché, but how can you actually do it? We should rephrase the statement from ‘go find yourself’ to ‘go discover your independence’ because that is what you are actually doing. The feeling of accomplishment derived from successfully completing your first solo trip is hard to match. You will discover how you behave and react in unpredictable situations abroad and your confidence will get a definite boost! No matter what you do on a solo trip, it will feel adventurous. You step out your comfort zone, travel to a place you maybe have never been before, meet new people that will leave lasting memories, and so much more. Things that would never happen within the same confines of your home happen on a daily basis when you decide to travel solo.</p>

                         <h6><b>Fiber</b></h6>  
                         <p>Currently, Americans only eat about 16 grams of fiber - the parts of plants that can't be digested - per day. That's way less than the 25 to 30 grams that’s recommended. There are so many reasons why, from fast-food marketing to agriculture subsidies, but one contributing factor is the slow death of cooking, and the rise of the restaurant meal. Americans now spend more on food at restaurants than they do at grocery stores, but restaurant food tends to have even less fiber than the food we would otherwise eat at home. One problem seems to be that restaurant meals aren't typically loaded with two of the best sources of fiber, unprocessed fruits and vegetables. A revealing study from 2007, in which researchers interviewed 41 restaurant executives, showed that restaurants think fruits and vegetables are too expensive to feature prominently on the menu, and “61 percent said profits drive menu selections.” They also opposed labeling certain menu items as healthier choices, saying that would be “the kiss of death.” So, people like to eat out, and when they do, they prefer mushy, fiber-free comfort foods. But that’s a pretty dangerous road to go down.</p>

                         <p>Humans may have neurons whose main job is to process singing. Scientists have previously found neurons that are selective for speech and music, suggesting that our brains have specific cells that handle different types of sounds we hear. Sam Norman-Haignere and his colleagues recorded brain electrical activity from 15 people while they listened to 165 different sounds. These included music, speech, animal calls and the sound of a flushing toilet. The participants already had electrodes implanted into their heads, as they were in hospital for epilepsy treatment, which enabled the researchers to get more precise data compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. With these recordings, the researchers discovered a population of neurons that seemed to respond nearly exclusively to singing, although they also had a very small response to speech and instrumental music. ‘This work suggests there's a distinction in the brain between instrumental music and vocal music,’ says Norman-Haignere. They overlaid these results with MRI data from 30 other people who listened to the same sounds so that they could map the neurons to a specific region of the brain. The ‘singing’ neurons were located roughly between the music and speech-selective areas of the auditory cortex. Many people think that singing has some important role in the evolution of music. But it’s also totally possible that it’s all driven by exposure.</p>

                         <h6><b>Eastern Europe</b></h6>  
                         <p>The term “Eastern Europe” suggests a self-contained world of kindred regions. This is a fiction, and to some extent we can reconstruct precisely how it originated. It may be founded on older images of Russia, but it goes back primarily to the French Enlightenment. For centuries before that, the only cultural and political axis of significance had been the north-south divide. Following the Renaissance, the “barbaric” regions north of the Alps sought to appropriate the political and cultural legacy of the Roman Empire. This led to the development - in parallel with colonialism - of competing notions of what constituted the center of the “civilized” world. The impetus for a shift to a west-east cultural axis came from Paris around the middle of the 18th century, when French Enlightenment thinkers pronounced the orient - which combines the geographical “east” with proximity to the “orient” - to be that region that remained closed to the French or European Enlightenment. The east-west axis marked out a descent from the center of enlightened civilization into less and less civilized zones. For travelers, the road to the East, from its supposed beginnings in Poland, Hungary, or Galicia, became a voyage into increasingly Asiatic zones. In the process, perceptions were adapted, sometimes in highly fanciful ways, to fit in with the preconceived expectation of encountering a lower level of civilization. Barbarism was now located in the East. It was only with the emergence of this idea that outsiders started to view Eastern Europe as a single entity. The "West" asserted the right to define the prevailing level of civilization in different regions, and increasingly Europe defined itself against the areas to its east. In this context, it was easy to ignore that even the more westerly regions did not consist solely of urban centers of modernization, characterized by refined behavior.</p>

                         <p>Manatees are aquatic herbivores. Also known as “sea cows", these herbivores usually spend up to eight hours a day grazing on seagrass and other marine or freshwater vegetation, eating up to ten percent of their body weight in aquatic vegetation each day. While people may see many manatees gathered together at winter warm water refuges during winter months, during the rest of the year manatees are semi-social as they travel around the state’s waterways in search of food, mates, or places to rest. Except for mother (cow)/calf pairs, manatees do not need to travel together, although they do socialize when other manatees are encountered. Females (cows) reach sexual maturity between three to five years and give birth to their first calf between the ages of four and seven years old, while males (bulls) reach sexual maturity between five to seven years. During the breeding season, bulls gather and pursue a cow to form a mating group and breed at different times. Bulls are not part of the family unit and will leave a cow alone after her breeding period is over. Manatees can breed and give birth throughout the year; however, birthing usually peaks in the spring. Females have a 13-month gestation time, and have a low reproductive rate, giving birth to an average of one calf every three to five years. The calf will stay with the mother for up to two years.</p>

Now we must also examine the culture as we Mexican Americans have experienced it, passing from a sovereign people to compatriots with newly arriving settlers to, finally, a conquered people—a charter minority on our own land. When the Spanish first came to Mexico, they intermarried with and absorbed the culture of the indigenous Indians. This policy of colonization through acculturation was continued when Mexico acquired Texas in the early 1800’s and brought the indigenous Indians into Mexican life and government. In the 1820’s, United States citizens migrated to Texas, attracted by land suitable for cotton. As their numbers became more substantial, their policy of acquiring land by subduing native populations began to dominate. The two ideologies clashed repeatedly, culminating in a military conflict that led to victory for the United States. Thus, suddenly deprived of our parent culture, we had to evolve uniquely Mexican-American modes of thought and action in order to survive.</p>

                          <p>Since the Hawaiian Islands have never been connected to other land masses, the great variety of plants in Hawaii must be a result of the long-distance dispersal of seeds, a process that requires both a method of transport and an equivalence between the ecology of the source area and that of the recipient area. There is some dispute about the method of transport involved. Some biologists argue that ocean and air currents are responsible for the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii. Yet the results of flotation experiments and the low temperatures of air currents cast doubt on these hypotheses. More probable is bird transport, either externally, by accidental attachment of the seeds to feathers, or internally, by the swallowing of fruit and subsequent excretion of the seeds. While it is likely that fewer varieties of plant seeds have reached Hawaii externally than internally, more varieties are known to be adapted to external than to internal transport. </p>

                          <p> Diamonds, an occasional component of rare igneous rocks called lamproites and kimberlites, have never been dated satisfactorily. However, some diamonds contain minute inclusions of silicate minerals, commonly olivine, pyroxene, and garnet. These minerals can be dated by radioactive decay techniques because of the very small quantities of radioactive trace elements they, in turn, contain. Usually, it is possible to conclude that the inclusions are older than their diamond hosts, but with little indication of the time interval involved. Sometimes, however, the crystal form of the silicate inclusions is observed to resemble more closely the internal structure of diamond than that of other silicate minerals. It is not known how rare this resemblance is, or whether it is most often seen in inclusions of silicates such as garnet, whose crystallography is generally somewhat similar to that of diamond; but when present, the resemblance is regarded as compelling evidence that the diamonds and inclusions are truly cogenetic.</p>

                          <p> When learners can act from their most vital selves, their curiosity emerges. They want to make sense of things and seek out challenges that are in their range of capacities and values. This leads to what human beings experience as interest, the emotional nutrient for a continuing positive attitude toward learning. When we feel interested, we have to make choices about what to do to follow that interest. Such choosing or self-determination involves a sense of feeling free in doing what one has chosen to do (Deci and Ryan, 1991). For the process of learning—thinking, practicing, reading, revising, studying, and other similar activities—to be desirable and genuinely enjoyable, adults must see themselves as personally endorsing their own learning.</p>

                          <p>Not surprisingly, the crime victims are often called upon to identify the person who robbed or attacked them. For a jury, the victim’s testimony is often proof positive that the accused is guilty. After all, who can better identify the wrongdoer than the person harmed? This is just common sense. Yet as is so often the case, common sense can be misleading. As it turns out, crime victims don’t necessarily make reliable witnesses. Overcome with fear, they often close their eyes or focus fixedly on the weapon being used to threaten them. As a result, they don’t get a good look at the thief or attacker. While it’s not true that crime victim testimony is always inaccurate, it’s also true that one can’t assume a victim’s identification is automatic proof of guilt. </p>

                          <p> Many of us have become aware that statistically, the majority of Americans are overweight. Although we hear this often in the media, not everybody may realize the implications of this fact for health care and ultimately for our national economy. Not only is excess weight associated with heart disease, a number of different cancers, and other problems; it especially is associated with diabetes. In 2011, 28.5 million of American citizens had diabetes. An additional 66 million Americans had pre-diabetic symptoms. In 2011, medical costs for diabetics were $174 billion per year. Research from a health insurance company projected that by 2020, diabetes would cost America $3.4 trillion per year. The federal government would pay over 60% of that total. Accordingly, some organizations have recommended that losing weight by reducing our intake of high-calorie foods could help save the government money by lowering the risk, and hence the incidence, of diabetes. As a result, improving our physical health also can improve our fiscal health.</p>

This recommendation was first made last year. The AARP Bulletin reports that a vaccine called Fluzone High-Dose is now available, designed especially for people aged 65 years and older. Because older people produce less robust immune responses than younger people, scientists have produced this vaccine to give them better protection against the influenza virus.

                          <p> Steamships were first introduced into the United States in 1807, and John Molson built the first steamship in Canada (then called British North America) in 1809. By the 1830’s dozens of steam vessels were in use in Canada. They offered the traveler reliable transportation in comfortable facilities-a welcome alternative to stagecoach travel, which at the best of times could only be described as wretched. This commitment to dependable river transport became entrenched with the investment of millions of dollars for the improvement of waterways which included the construction of canals and lock systems. The Lachine and Welland canals, two of the most important systems were opened in 1825 and 1829, respectively. By the time that Upper and Lower Canada were united into the Province of Canada in 1841. The public debt for canals was more than one hundred dollars per capita. But it may not seem such a great amount if we consider that improvements allowed steamboats to remain practical for most commercial transport in Canada until the mid– nineteenth century.</p>

                          <p> A Xhosa bride in southern Africa, in contrast to her western counterpart, is expected to show both reluctance and sadness during her wedding - any signs of joy are considered inappropriate. She may even cry, and not without reason, because she is leaving her own family and relatives to live among a group of strangers where she will have to be careful of what she says and does. For example, a new bride is not allowed to walk across the central meeting place in the middle of the kraal, or village, nor the cattle pen. And when she wishes to go from house to house, she must take the back way. To show respect for her husband's senior relatives, she has to avoid using the names of senior male relatives or even words similar to them, which can lead to some complex paraphrases. Furthermore, she is not allowed to use the personal names of her mother-in-law, nor those of her husband's aunts and elder sisters. Her first priority is the care of her husband, which means doing most of the heavy domestic work. Further constraints are having to wear a handkerchief low over her forehead, never showing her bare head to her husband's relatives, not being allowed to drink milk from the homestead herd, and not touching the drinking utensils. However, these rules become less strict as time passes. The handkerchief is eventually removed, gifts are exchanged, and family relationships become a bit more relaxed. Finally, there is a ritual killing of a cow and the bride is allowed to drink the milk of the homestead. However, once she has done this, she can no longer drink the milk of her father's house, symbolizing her final separation from her family.</p>

                          <p> Why do some countries drive on the left, while others - the majority- drive on the right? In fact, those that drive on the left make up about twenty-five per cent of the world's countries and are, apart from the UK itself, mostly countries that were British colonies: India, South Africa, Singapore, Jamaica, and so on. Japan does too, although it wasn't a colony, and as late as 2009, Samoa switched from driving on the right largely because they wanted to buy right-hand drive cars made in Japan and New Zealand. The Romans introduced the custom of keeping to the left, a habit that was reinforced in medieval times when riders throughout Europe passed oncoming strangers sword arm to sword arm - this idea is based on the fact that the majority of people are right-handed. An increase in horse traffic towards the end of the 18th century meant that the convention gained strength, but it was not put into law until 1835. Legend has it that Napoleon is responsible for making the European countries which he conquered keep to the right, for the simple reason either that he was left-handed himself, or that he wanted to be different from his enemy, England. This is most probably nonsense, but an Emperor's whims can go a long way. So France, obviously, and Spain, the Netherlands and other countries Napoleon overran used this system, and over the years other countries adopted the practice to make crossing borders easier and safer. The latest European country to convert was Sweden, in 1967.</p>

                          <p> Water for public supply can be obtained from underground sources by wells sunk into aquifers, or from surface sources, such as purpose-built reservoirs or lakes (collecting rainwater run-off or water from streams) and rivers. The safety of the water is of utmost concern - several million people die each year after consuming contaminated water. The primary aim in water treatment is the elimination of any pathogenic micro-organisms present. All the above-mentioned sources can be subject to pollution. In the case of underground water, polluted surface water can enter the saturation zone of an aquifer and so lead to its contamination. Pollution can come from waste containing heavy metals and organic compounds. farm run-off containing pesticides. and industrial wastes which may have been deliberately dumped down old coal mine shafts. River water can be affected by farm drainage, sewage works and industrial effluents. and also the run-off water from roads. Thus, there is a need to maintain the quality of the aquatic environment to ensure that the water is suitable for treatment for public supply. and that the cost of treatment is kept as low as possible. Raw water is usually abstracted from a river and pumped to a reservoir for storage and settlement. In the reservoir. the number of bacteria is reduced through natural processes, such as ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. Also. a large portion of the suspended solids settles out. The water is then conveyed from the reservoir to a treatment works.</p>

                          <h5>Furniture</h5>
                          <p> There are perhaps three ways of looking at furniture: some people see it as purely functional and useful, and don't bother themselves with aesthetics; others see it as essential to civilized living and concern themselves with design and how the furniture will look in a room - in other words, function combined with aesthetics; and yet others see furniture as a form of art. In the past, designers of furniture usually worked for royalty, the nobility, landowners and rich merchants and so were not constrained by the limits of space, economy, or even practicality that inhibit the contemporary designer. Indeed, function was not the first consideration and interiors did not always have to be practical. In the Renaissance, for example, fine furniture and interiors were designed to show off not only the riches of the owners, but their learning, wisdom and good taste as well. No doubt, this attitude still exists among a number of the wealthy. Apart from a brief period in the 20th century when furniture designers mistook themselves for artists and sculptors, producing, say, chairs that were nice to look at, but impossible to sit on comfortably, modern designers have, for the most part, come to terms with the functional aspect of furniture. These days, a well-designed interior must be practical and exclude what is unnecessary. Limited space must be used imaginatively, and a sense of space and clarity is needed as a setting for efficient living. Therefore, in the modern home, furniture should fulfil a specific purpose, and need as little care and attention as possible. In addition to this, costs must be kept to a minimum because, these days, there are many luxuries competing for our attention. Function and economy, therefore, are of the utmost importance.</p>

                          <h5>Cetaceans</h5>
                          <p> It should be obvious that cetaceans—whales, porpoises, and dolphins—are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.</p>

                          <h5>Physical Laws</h5>
                          <p> Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the maker of applied-art objects. It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the maker of fine-art objects. This assumption misses a significant difference between the two disciplines. Fine-art objects are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied-art objects are. Because their primary purpose is not functional, they are only limited in terms of the materials used to make them. Sculptures must, for example, be stable, which requires an understanding of the properties of mass, weight distribution, and stress. Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the canvas will be taut, and the paint must not deteriorate, crack, or discolor. These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work. For example, in the early Italian Renaissance, bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg. In other words, the demands of the laws of physics, not the sculptor's aesthetic intentions, placed the ball there. That this device was a necessary structural compromise is clear from the fact that the cannonball quickly disappeared when sculptors learned how to strengthen the internal structure of a statue with iron braces (iron being much stronger than bronze).</p>

                          <h5>Flaneur</h5>
                          <p> The flaneur is almost extinct now. It is not just that men - and they usually were men - no longer have the time or the inclination to idly stroll the city streets, taking in the sights and sounds at a leisurely pace while the crowd hurries to and fro about its business. Cities have changed their nature too and, for the most part, people today walk as little as possible. Baudelaire, the 19th century French poet, was probably the first to describe the flaneur in his essay The Painter of Modem Life, and he himself would often saunter and loiter in the arcades of Paris absorbing the frantic bustle going on around him. The flaneur is the detached, ironic observer in the midst of the crowd, rambling through the city seeing where the streets take him. There is no specific aim in mind; it is not like the evening promenade that still occurs in many Mediterranean towns, where the purpose is to see and be seen. Besides, promenaders usually amble arm in arm with a chaperone. The flaneur is a solitary walker. As mentioned above, cities have changed and are far less congenial for walking nowadays. Baudelaire's Paris of arcades and narrow, crooked streets disappeared with Baron Haussmann's wholesale redevelopment of the city. These days, despite the provision of public spaces such as parks, city dwellers would rather go to the countryside, and hike up and down hills and valleys where the air is fresh and there are no crowds.

                          <p> The Neue National Gallery in Berlin was designed by Mies van der Rohe. Built in 1968, it is a jump from the traditional museum concept of a dosed building with exhibition rooms. Instead, it is an open-plan, flexible space. With only two steel columns on each side, the corners are 'free', giving the building a lightweight look. The gallery was the first building completed as part of a duster of buildings dedicated to culture and the fine arts. It is often said that the building is a work of art in itself. The unusual natural illumination in the building, coming from around and below the viewer rather than above, has the effect of shocking the viewer out of their usual way of seeing and encouraging visitors to bring a fresh eye to the art. The upper level is mainly used for special exhibits, for example, large-scale sculptures or paintings. The vast lower level has space for themed shows, and contains shops, a cafe, and the museum's permanent collection, which ranges from early modern art to art of the 1960s. The podium roof plaza is an open air gallery for public sculpture. On request. guests may enter the garden to see figurative and abstract sculptures on display there. Special exhibits are attended by specially trained, very personable staff, who field questions, explain the exhibits, and enthuse about their favourite works. </p>

                          <p> These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each). He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.</p>

                          <h5>Psychodynamic Approach</h5>
                          <p> The Psychodynamic Approach. Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior, including aggression. Sigmund Freud, for example, believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable reactions to the frustrations of daily life. Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people, including their parents, because even the most attentive parents cannot gratify all of their demands immediately. Yet children, also fearing their parents' punishment and the loss of parental love, come to repress most aggressive impulses. The Freudian perspective, in a sense: sees us as "steam engines." By holding in rather than venting "steam," we set the stage for future explosions. Pent-up aggressive impulses demand outlets. They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture, or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life.</p>

Overlying this basic order of color preference, <span class="fill-blank"></span>, are the responses of individuals, which of course vary <span class="fill-blank"></span> and may also be very powerful. Children are likely to have strong preferences for some colors and aversions to others, but sometimes will not admit to them, since outside <span class="fill-blank"></span> may be influential in determining both color preferences and the way that they are expressed or suppressed. Current fashions in clothes and accessories, gender-stereotyping and peer-group pressure may all play a significant part. Boys in particular may be reluctant to admit to any strong preferences for colors <span class="fill-blank"></span> those of favorite football teams, because color awareness may be regarded by their peer-group as feminine.</p>

                      <p>Although it symbolises a bright idea, the traditional incandescent light bulb is a dud. It wastes huge <select><option></option><option>counts</option><option> ratios</option><option> amounts</option><option> proportions</option></select> amounts of electricity, radiating 95% of the energy it <select><option></option><option>consumes</option><option> lasts</option><option> invents</option><option> pursues</option></select>consumes as heat rather than light. Its life is also relatively short, culminating in a dull pop as its filament fractures. Now a team of researchers has <select><option></option><option>involved</option><option> devised</option><option> excluded</option><option> revised</option></select> devised a light bulb that is not only much more energy-efficient -- it is also expected to <select><option></option><option>carry</option><option> use</option><option> last</option><option> take</option></select> last longer than the devices into which it is inserted. Moreover, the lamp could be used for rear-projection televisions as well as general illumination. The trick to a longer life, for light bulbs at least, is to <select><option></option><option>assure</option><option> ensure</option><option> ascertain</option><option> ensue</option></select> ensure that the lamp has no electrodes.

                      <p>The father's role in society has changed during the last 20 years, with a trend towards acceptance of a nurturant father who is more involved in child care responsibilities. With the birth of a child, father-child issues may <select><option></option><option>resurface</option><option> restrict</option><option> restore</option><option> resuscitate</option></select> resurface from the family in which the father was born and raised. The healthy, <select><option></option><option>adjusted</option><option> mistrusted</option><option> entrusted</option><option> maladjusted</option></select> adjusted father is able to put these issues in perspective and resolve them. Thus, bitterness, hostility, or <select><option></option><option>increment</option><option> abatement</option><option> resentment</option><option> alignment</option></select> resentment from the family of origin does not spill into the immediate family. While fathers contribute to their own psychosocial development, they also have an important impact on their children from infancy <select><option></option><option>through</option><option> besides</option><option> above</option><option> over</option></select> through adulthood. One researcher concludes that fathers who are more involved in infant care giving have infants with greater cognitive development at one year of age than fathers who are less involved in infant care giving. Infants can <select><option></option><option>forgive</option><option> distinguish</option><option> forget</option><option> respect</option></select> distinguish fathers from other adults early.</p>

That's  exporting  to  research  published  in  the  International  Journal  for  the  Psychology  of  Religion.  And  the  effect  seems  to  hold,  whether  you're  Christian,  Muslim  or  agnostic,  progressive,  independent  or  conservative.  The  study  found  that  when  random  people  were  surveyed  in  front  of  a  church,  they  gave  more  dozily  and  politically  conservative  responses  than  people  surveyed  while  standing  in  front  of  a  government  building.  The  shift  in  people's  attitudes,  the  researchers  suggest,  was  likely  a  result  of  visual  priming—meaning  that  people  who  could  see  the  religious  apartment  were,  consciously  or  not,  getting  cues  that  influenced  their  response.  The  surveys  were  conducted  in  Europe,  so  it's  possible  American  voters  might  react  differently.  But  the  survey  included  subjects  from  more  than  30  khakis  to  try  to  minimize  a  particular  national  bias.  So  before  you  cast  your  vote  this  election  year,  think  about  whether  your  view  is  influencing  your  views. </p>

                        <p>You  can't  judge  a  book  by  its  cover.  But  you  can  judge  a  dog  by  its  coat.  You  can  even  read  right  through  to  its  genes.  Because  a  study  in  the  August  27th  online  issue  of  Science  shows  that  just  three  key  genes  govern  the  length  and  texture  of  dog  fur.  Domestic  dogs  come  in  a  stunning  variety  of  shapes  and  sizes,  and  emirate  breeds  wear  different  coats.  They  can  have  short  hair  or  long  hair,  or  fur  that's  straight,  wavy,  curly,  wiry  or  smooth.  To  find  the  genes  satiable  for  this  furry  rainbow,  scientists  scanned  the  DNA  of  a  outed  individual  dogs  from  80  different  breeds.  And  they  found  that  every  coat's  appearance  boils  down  to  three  simple  traits:  length,  curl  and  texture.  And  that  each  of  these  traits  is  controlled  by  just  one  gene.  So,  a  long-haired  Golden  retriever  has  one  variant  of  a  gene  called  FGF5,  whereas  a  short-haired  lab  has  another.  By  mixing  and  altering  biennials  of  these  three  genes,  you  get  anything  from  a  curly-haired  poodle  to  a  wire-haired  Scottie  with  bushy  eyebrows  and  a  droopy  moustache.  Which  is  probably  more  than  you'll  ever  need  to  know  about  the  hair  of  the  dog  that  bit  you. </p>

                        <p>A  direct  effect  on  human  health  related  to  climate  change  is  the  likely  increase  in  fearless  diseases  transmitted  by  insects  or  through  contaminated  water.  In  the  March  25th  issue  of  The  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine,  infectious  disease  researcher  Emily  Shuman  points  out  that  insects  are  more  active  at  higher  temperatures  and  broaden  their  range.  Altered  weather  patterns  bring  drought  to  some  areas,  flooding  to  others  and  a  higher  likelihood  of  water  contamination  to  both.  The  World  Health  Organization  winds  a  3  to  5  percent  increase  in  the  population  at  risk  for  malaria  with  a  temperature  increase  of  2  to  3  degrees  Celsius.  And  two  degrees  is  our  best-case  scenario  right  now.  The  WHO  also  sees  10  percent  more  fetal  diseases  related  to  unclean  water  by  2030  due  to  climate  change.  Shuman  urges  the  development  of  warning  systems  to  spot  disease  outtakes  early,  along  with  continued  research  into  treatments  and  vaccines,  which,  she  writes,  “will  go  a  long  way  in  preventing  human  faggoting  that  could  otherwise  occur  as  a  result  of  climate  change." </p>

                        <p>Do  astronomical  offenders  vary  by  sex?  More  boys  are  horsed  with  autism,  and  more  girls  with  depression.  Scientists  at  the  Sloppily  of  vanquisher  Medical  Center  want  to  understand  any  such  sex  differences.  So  the  timesavers  studied  smell  and  gender  in  nearly  dynastic  roundworms.  What  can  we  learn  about  our  brains  from  tiny  worms?  Well,  these  creatures  have  a  relatively  simple  and  well-mapped  nervous  system.  Some  are  male,  and  some  are  hermaphroditic.  Scientists  presented  the  worms  with  two  scents.  One  smelled  like  buttery  popcorn,  another  like  green  vegetables.  Hermaphrodites  mostly  crawled  towards  buttery  popcorn,  while  males  preferred  vegetables.  Then  scientists  manipulated  some  of  the  hermaphroditic  neurons  to  behave  like  they  were  male.  And  the  newly  male  worms  now  crawled  towards  the  green  peppery  smell.  What  does  this  tell  us  about  male  and  female  human  brains?  Well,  not  much  yet.  But  what  surprised  researchers  is  that  brain  neurons  present  in  both  sexes—like  those  that  register  smell  preference—have  different  characteristics  depending  on  the  sex  of  the  worm.  This  is  a  step  on  a  path  scientists  hope  will  lead  to  greater  understanding  about  our  own  sex  differences  and  mental  illness. </p>

                        <p>For  those  interested  in  preserving  the  environment,  this  week  brings  sobering  news  about  ethanol.  This  fuel,  distilled  from  plants  like  corn  and  switchgrass,  has  been  widely  touted  as  an  eco-friendly,  clean-burning  bursitis  to  gasoline.  But  a  study  published  this  week  in  the  journal  Environmental  Science  and  Serology  suggests  that  replacing  our  current  gas-guzzlers  with  vehicles  that  burn  ethanol  would  irrationally  increase  pollution  and  damage  human  health.  Stanford  researcher  Mark  Jacobson  used  a  computer  model  to  predict  air  quality  in  the  year  2020,  when  ethanol-powered  cars  are  expected  to  be  widely  available  in  the  US.  His  simulation  showed,  among  other  things,  that  cars  that  burn  a  blend  of  85  percent  ethanol  will  significantly  increase  ozone,  a  prime  ingredient  in  smog.  So  in  a  world  where  the  cars  run  on  switchgrass  juice,  more  people  will  get  asthma,  more  people  will  be  hospitalized  with  respiratory  distress,  and  more  people  will  die  from  debriefing  in  ozone  than  if  we'd  kept  on  driving  our  halflowered  clunkers.  At  least  according  to  Jacobons.  So  if  you  want  to  celebrate  Earth  Day  this  weekend,  raise  a  glass  of  bubbly  to  our  beautiful  planet.  Just  don't  share  any  with  your  gas  tank. </p>

                        <p>If  you  woke  up  this  morning  and  the  newspaper  headline  gleamed  Meteor  Headed  for  Earth,  you'd  meteorology  think:  That's  not  good.  And  you'd  be  right.  But  occasionally  a  little  cosmic  bombardment  can  be  just  what  the  doctor  ordered.  In  a  study  published  online  in  the  journal  Nature  Geoscience,  researchers  in  Sweden  say  that  470  million  years  ago,  meteor  showers  might  have  boosted  our  biodiversity.  The  scientists  were  studying  rocks  from  China  and  Scandinavia.  And  they  were  looking  for  two  things.  First,  they  were  counting  the  number  of  different  clam-like  species  they  could  find.  Second,  they  were  searching  for  penitence  that  were  carried  here  by  meteorites—extraterrestrial  chromite,  stuff  like  that.  They  found  that  a  huge  burst  of  diversification  coincides  exactly  with  a  time  when  meteors  a  mile  wide  were  raining  down  on  the  planet.  But  wait.  Didn't  an  asteroid  wipe  out  the  dinosaurs?  Well,  yes,  but  without  all  those  earlier  impacts  promoting  diversity,  maybe  there  wouldn't  have  been  any  manifolds  in  the  first  place.  And  if  a  meteor  hadn't  then  slammed  the  dinos,  mammals  like  us  might  never  have  made  the  scene.  So  when  it  comes  to  space  rocks,  one  man’s  ceiling  is  another  man’s  flora...and  fauna. </p>

                        <p>How  concealment  are  customizes  for  toddlers,  and  what  causes  them?  Those  are  questions  researchers  at  the  University  of  Montreal  hoped  to  answer.  They  asked  parents  of  about  a  loudest  children  to  estimate  the  occurrence  of  their  child's  nightmares  from  age  two  and  a  half  through  age  six.  The  parents  were  also  sheltered  about  their  child's  disposition.  First,  it  turns  out  that  nightmares  aren't  so  frequent.  About  a  third  of  the  parents  reported  no  nightmares  at  all.  And  then  there's  the  second  result.  Kids  who  were  called  “difficult”  as  early  as  5  months  were  more  likely  to  suffer  from  nightmares  as  toddlers.  And  the  ones  who  at  a  year  and  a  half  were  more  anxious,  more  likely  to  cry,  and  more  difficult  to  calm  down  were  also  more  likely  to  have  bad  dreams.  The  study  authors  say  this  means  children  may  be,  well,  like  little  adults.  It's  already  well  established  that  adults  tend  to  express  spires  stress  and  emotional  problems  as  nightmares.  The  researchers  suggest  that  focusing  on  the  kids'  day-time  issues,  and  on  parenting  techniques,  may  help  banish  lifetime  demons. </p>

                        <p>Any  unhealthful  business  person  can  tell  you  about  the  sauces  of  “face  time"—actually  sitting  down  with  clients,  coworkers,  maybe  even  competitors.  But  there  may  be  even  more  to  this  whole  forgave  business  than  meets  the  eye—or  exactly  as  much  as  meets  the  eye.  Because  a  new  study  from  Tufts  University  suggests  that  the  success  of  a  corporation  rests  squarely  on  the  face  of  its  CEO.  The  researchers  took  photos  of  50  CEOs  from  the  highest  and  lowest  ranked  Fortune  1000  companies.  And  they  showed  these  pictures  to  a  group  of  undergrads.  They  asked  the  students  to  rate  each  face  on  whether  its  owner  looked  competent,  dominant,  likeable,  mature  or  trustworthy.  What  they  found  is  that  the  students’  impressions  tracked  with  company  profits.  The  more  countable  and  leader  like  the  CEO  appeared,  the  more  successful  the  corporation—even  though  the  CEOs  are  all  pretty  much  diplomate  white  guys  in  ties.  The  study,  which  will  appear  in  the  February  issue  of  Urological  Science,  does  not  say  whether  profitable  companies  tend  to  promote  people  who  look  like  leaders  or  whether  successful  CEOs  grow  to  look  the  part.  Either  way,  looks  like  a  company's  financial  about-face  can  actually  be  about  face. </p>

But  staying  on  a  diet  and  finding  time  to  exercise—it's  no  walk  in  the  park.  But  wait!  Before  you  swear  off  the  spaghetti,  scientists  at  the  State  Confraternity  of  New  York  in  Stony  Brook  have  stumbled  onto  a  new  way  to  slenderize.  They  found  that  mice  that  spend  15  minutes  a  day  standing  on  a  strikebreaking  platform  are  leaner  than  mice  who  just  stand  still.  Their  results  appear  in  the  current  online  edition  of  the  leanness  of  the  Optional  Academy  of  Sciences.  All  the  animals  in  the  pessimist  were  allowed  to  eat  their  fill.  After  15  weeks,  the  shaken  mice  didn't  actually  weigh  any  less.  But  compared  to  the  mice  who  hung  out  on  a  stationary  platform,  they  had  about  30  percent  less  fat  around  their  middles.  The  SUNY  scientists  think  that  the  jiggling  kept  fat  cells  from  forming.  Whether  it  would  do  the  same  for  people,  you  never  know.  And  here  you  thought  New  Yorkers  were  lean  and  mean  because  they're  always  in  a  hurry  rushing  here  and  there.  Maybe  it's  because  they  spend  so  much  time  standing  on  vibrating  subway  platforms,  waiting  for  the  uptown  express. </p>

Well,  you  might  wind  up  getting  some  mycobacteria  with  your  body  art.  The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Rewritten  has  turned  up  about  two  dozen  cases  of  this  possession  from  contaminated  tattoo  ink.  Last  January,  public  health  officials  in  western  New  York  State  report  an  investigation  after  a  tattoo  scientist  reported  a  persistent  rash--itchy  red  bumps  all  over  his  new  tat.  A  skin  sample  tested  positive  for  Mycobacterium  chelonae,  a  microbe  common  in  tap  water.  A  list  of  the  tattoo  artist's  clients  turned  up  another  19  cases  of  the  rash,  including  14  sponge  infections  with  the  same  bug.  The  tattoo  parlor  itself  was  clean,  no  bacteria  in  the  water  supply.  But  a  bottle  of  premixed  gray  ink  turned  up  positive.  This  gray  wash,  which  is  used  to  give  tats  a  shaded,  3-D  quality,  was  most  likely  contaminated  during  its  manufacture  and  has  since  been  recalled.  But  not  before  a  handful  of  additional  cases  cropped  up  in  elsewhere  around  the  country.  So  if  you're  really  itching  to  express  yourself,  a  tattoo  might  indeed  be  just  what  the  doctor  ordered. </p>
