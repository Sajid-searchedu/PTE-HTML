        <h1>Part 3: Becoming A Pro With Use of Tenses</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <p>There are three verb tenses: Past, Present, and Future.</p>
        <p>But within each of these three, there are 4 forms as well, such as Past Perfect, Past Continuous, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Past tense </b> is used when you’re talking about an <b> event that has already occurred. </b></p>
        <p><b>Present tense </b> is used to discuss <b>something that is currently taking place</b> or is continuous. </p>
        <p><b>Future tense </b> is used when <b> something is yet to happen</b>, or, it will take place in the future.</p>
        <p class="mt-5">Let’s get into each of them and understand them in a simple manner.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h4><b><u>4 Types of Present Tenses</u></b></h4>
      </div>
      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>1) Simple Present</b></h5>
        <p>A simple present has two uses. It is used when an <b> action is happening right now </b> or when <b>it happens regularly</b>. The second use is to talk about habitual actions or occurrences. </p>
        <p>Depending on the person, a simple present is formed by adding <b>‘es’</b> or <b>‘s’</b> to the root form of the verb.</p>
        <p>In the simple present, most verbs use the root form except in the third person, which requires the addition of an ‘s’.</p>
        <p>For instance, the verb ‘write’ would be used in the first person singular as “I write”. </p>
        <p>In the second person, it would be used as, “You write”. </p>
        <p>However, in the third person, it would be used as, “He/She/it write<b>s</b>”. Notice, that in the third person, the verb ended with an ‘s’.</p>
        <p>Some verbs, when in the third person, end in <b>‘es’</b> instead of <b>‘s’</b>. These verbs are usually ones that in their root form end with <b> o, ch, sh, th, ss, gh </b> or <b> z</b>.</p>
        <p>For example, the verb ‘go’ would be used in the singular first person as “I go”. </p>
        <p>In the second person as “You go”. </p>
        However, in the third person, it would be used as, “He/She/it go<b>es</b>”. You can see that since this verb ended with an ‘o’, it required the addition of ‘es’ to be used in the third person.
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>2) Present Perfect</b></h5>
          <p>Present perfect tense refers to when <b> something started in the past and has continued up to the present </b> time. </p>
          <p>This tense is formed by <b> have/has + the past participle</b>.</p>
          <p>The construction is very simple. The first part is <b> has</b> or <b>have </b> depending on the subject. The second part is the past participle which is usually formed by adding an <b>‘ed’</b> or <b>‘d’</b> at the end of the verb’s root form. </p>
          <p>Some examples are, walk<b>ed</b>, talk<b>ed</b>, cook<b>ed</b>, change<b>d</b>, bake<b>d</b>, exercise<b>d</b>, etc.</p>
          <p>However, this rule does not apply to irregular verbs. Some irregular past participle words are: slept, fell, took, thought, broke, won, etc.</p>
          <p>For example, “<b>I have told</b> him to come home early so we can eat dinner together.”</p>
          <p>One thing you must remember is that past participle cannot be used when you are being specific about when something occurred. </p>
          <p>For example, “<b>I have baked</b> some cookies this evening.” This sentence is incorrect because it is specifying the time the activity occurred at. The correct sentence would be, “<b>I have baked</b> some cookies.”</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>3) Present Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>This tense is used to indicate <b> an action that is happening now and may continue into the future.</b></p>
          <p>It is constructed by <b>am/is/are + verb [present participle]</b>.</p>
          <p>For example, “My brother and I <b> are spending </b> the weekend in a cabin in the woods. We <b>are going</b> to a lake nearby for fishing.”</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>4) Present Perfect Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>Present perfect continuous tense is used <b> to show something that started in the past and is still continuing up till the present</b> time. </p>
          <p>It is constructed by <b> has/have + been + [root form of verb + ing].</b></p>
          <p>For example, “hey <b>have been playing </b> football for an hour.”</p>
          <p>Another example is, “He <b> has been studying</b> in the library for three hours!”</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h4><b><u>4 Types of Past Tenses</u></b></h4>
      </div>
       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>1) Simple Past</b></h5>
          <p>Simple past tense is used to talk about <b> something that happened in the past.</b> </p>
          <p>To reiterate, present continuous talks about something that started in the past and continued till the present time. In contrast, the simple past is something that has already finished at some point in the past.</p>
          <p>Simple past tense is constructed by adding<b> ed </b> at the end of a regular verb. If the regular verb already ends in <b>e</b>, then we only add <b>d</b>. Some examples are talk<b>ed</b>, walk<b>ed</b>, call<b>ed</b>, lov<b>ed</b>, typ<b>ed</b>, etc.</p>
          <p>However, irregular verbs are a bit more complicated. Some irregular verbs stay the same after being converted to simple past, such as <b>hit</b>, <b>cut</b>, <b>put</b>, <b>cost</b>, and <b>made</b>. </p>
          <p>To make simple past verbs negative, you can use the formula <b> did not + [root form of verb]</b>. This formula can be used for both regular and irregular verbs. You can also use the contraction <b>didn’t</b> instead of <b>did not</b>.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>2) Past Perfect</b></h5>
          <p>The past perfect tense is used to talk about <b> something that happened before the time in the past being mentioned</b>.</p>
          <p>The formula for this tense is: <b>had + past participle</b>. </p>
          <p>For example, “He <b> had earned</b> a lot of money, so he bought a new car.” This sentence tells us that he had bought a car in the past because he had earned a lot of money.</p>
          <p><b>But what’s the difference between the past perfect and simple past?</b></p>
          <p>Past perfect is used when you’re talking about some point in the past and want to refer to an event that happened even earlier. </p>
          <p>Consider the difference between these two sentences, “He <b> earned</b> a lot of money so he bought a new car” and “He <b>had earned</b> a lot of money so bought a new car.”</p>
          <p>The difference is subtle, but both sentences have a different meaning. The first sentence leaves the impression that he generally earned a lot of money, aside from that instance as well. However, the second sentence shows that he had earned a lot of money in that instance only, so he bought a new car. </p>
          <p>Another time to <b> use past perfect tense is when you’re expressing a condition and a result</b>.</p>
          <p>For example, “If I <b>had earned</b> that much money, I would have put it into my savings account.” The past perfect tense is used in the part of the sentence that explains the condition.</p>
          <p>However, never use past perfect tense when you’re not mentioning a sequence of events. </p>
          <p>For example, using “He <b>had bought</b> a new car” would be incorrect. It would imply that this event happened before another past event. The reader or listener would be waiting for you to tell them what happened after ‘He bought a new car’. Unless you’re mentioning something that happened after the event, using past perfect tense wouldn’t make sense.</p>
          <p>To make past perfect negative, use <b>had + not + [past participle].</b> </p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>3) Past Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>Past continuous tense refers to <b> a continuing action or state that happened at some time in the past</b>. </p>
          <p>It is formed by combining <b>“was/were”</b> and the verb’s present participle. The present participle is formed by adding <b> –ing</b> to the root form of the verb.</p>
          <p>This tense can be used to describe conditions that existed in the past, such as “The sun <b>was shining</b> every day that summer.”</p>
          <p>It can also be used to describe something continuous that was interrupted by another action. </p>
          <p>For example, “Alan <b>was cutting</b> the grass when a snake appeared.”</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>4) Past Perfect Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>Past perfect continuous tense is used <b> to talk about something that started in the past, continued in the past, and ended at some time in the past.</b></p>
          <p>It can be constructed by the formula <b> had been + the verb’s present participle</b>.</p>
            <p>Some examples of this tense are, “She <b> had been studying</b> in the library before she came to class,” “They <b>had been playing </b> football when the rain started to pour” and, “He <b>had been knocking</b> on the door for 10 minutes before realized that I wasn’t home.” </p>
            <p>Some words that you may see being used with this tense are <b> for, since, before</b>, and <b>when</b>.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h4><b><u>4 Types of Future Tenses</u></b></h4>
      </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>1) Simple Future</b></h5>
          <p>The simple future tense is <b> used to talk about something that will start and end at some time in the future.</b> </p>
           <p>There are two formulas for constructing this tense. The first one is <b> will + [root form of verb]</b>. The second formula is <b>am/is/are + going to + [root form of verb]</b>.</p>
           <p>It doesn’t matter if the subject is singular or plural. Both these formulas can be used for either one. </p>
           <p>However, the <b> going to</b> formula is more on the informal side, so try to stick with the <b> will + root form of the verb </b> for formal writing. </p>
           <p>Some examples are, “<b>I’m going to learn</b> how to play the guitar,” “<b>I will buy</b> a car once I get my driving license” and, “He <b>will teach</b> me how to get better at hockey.”</p>
           <p>You can make simple future negative by adding <b> not</b> between <b>will</b> and the <b>root form of the verb</b>. The formula for it is, <b>will + not + [root form of verb]</b>. The <b>going to</b> formula for simple future negative is, <b>am/is/are + not + going to + [root form of verb]</b>.</p>

       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>2) Future Perfect</b></h5>
          <p>The future perfect tense is<b> used to talk about an event or action that will be completed at some time in the future.</b> </p>
          <p>The formula for future perfect tense is <b> will have + [past participle]</b>. It doesn’t matter if the subject is singular or plural. The formula will remain the same. </p>
          <p>An example is “He <b>will have left</b> by 7 am for his flight.”</p>
          <p>To make a negative future perfect, all you have to do is a place <b>not</b> between <b>will</b> and <b>have</b>. The formula for it is <b>will + not + have + [past participle]</b>. You can use the contraction <b>won’t</b> instead of <b> will not</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>3) Future Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>Future continuous tense indicates that <b> something will occur in the future and will continue for some time.</b></p>
          <p>It is constructed using the formula <b> will + be + present participle (root verb + -ing)</b>.</p>
          <p>For example, “<b>I will be watching</b> the football match tomorrow.”</p>
          <p>This construction indicates that the action will not happen in an instant. Instead, it will continue for some time before finishing. Therefore, <b>the will + be + present participle </b> always indicates the future continuous tense.</p>
          <p>However, it is important to note that future continuous tense can only be used with action verbs. </p>
          <p>Some examples of action verbs are <b> watching, running, eating, sleeping, seeing,</b> and <b>thinking</b>.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>4) Future Perfect Continuous</b></h5>
          <p>Future perfect continuous tense is used <b> to describe an action or event that will continue up to some point in the future and will be completed.</b></p>
          <p>The formula for this construction is <b> will + have + been + [present participle]</b>.</p>
          <p>An example of this tense is, “Next month, I <b> will have been working</b> in this company for fifteen years.”</p>
       </div>

       <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h4><b><u>Parallelism and Voices</u></b></h4>
        <p>Lastly, in this section, I’d like to discuss <b> Parallelism</b>, and <b>Active & Passive Voices</b>. These will assist you in forming your sentences correctly and more effectively.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="mb-4"><b>Parallelism</b></h5>
          <p>Parallelism is when you <b>balance the grammatical structure of words, clauses, sentences, or phrases in your writing</b>. </p>
          <p>When we are writing in the form of a series or a list, <b>each item or word of the list or series must have the same grammatical form</b>.</p>
          <p>A noun should be balanced with a noun, a clause with a clause, an adverb with an adverb, a verb with a verb, and so on.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>Some examples of the parallelism are</b></h5>
          <p><u><b>Infinitive:</b></u> “I wanted <b>to go</b> to London <b>visiting</b> my brother.”</p>
          <p>This sentence is incorrect as the first item was an infinitive and the second was a gerund. Since the first was an infinitive, the second one must be an infinitive too. </p> 
          <p>The correct version of this sentence would be, “I wanted <b>to go</b> to London <b>to visit</b> my brother.”</p>
       </div>
       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <p><b><u>Gerund:</u></b> “My family’s <b>going</b> to Australia and will be <b>to settle</b> over there.”</p>
          <p>This sentence is wrong as well because it isn’t balanced. To give it a parallel structure, we will have to balance it by replacing the second item with its gerund form. </p>
          <p>The correct sentence is, “My family’s <b>going</b> to Australia and will be <b>settling</b> over there.”</p>
       </div>

        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <p><b><u>Adjectives:</u></b> “My new blanket is <b>comfortable, soft, and not dirty</b> .”</p>
          <p>The first two items in this sentence are both adjectives. However, since the third one is a verb, the sentence is incorrect. </p>
          <p>The correct sentence would be, “My new blanket is <b> comfortable, soft, and clean</b>.” </p>
       </div>


        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>Active & Passive Voices</b></h5>
          <p>Active voice is when the <b>subject</b> is doing the action of the <b>verb</b>. Passive voice is when the <b>victim </b> of the action (the <b>object</b>) becomes the subject. </p>
          <p>For example, “<b>I</b> am <b>digging</b> in the <b>ground</b>” is active voice. “The <b>ground</b> was <b>dug</b> by me” is passive. </p>
          <p>In this sentence, ‘ground’ is now the new subject and the previous subject can be eliminated or put in place of the victim.</p>
          <p>When it comes to changing active voice to passive voice, there are three rules you must follow:</p>

          <ol class="pl-3">
            <li>Move the object of the sentence and make it the subject.</li>
            <li>Add <b>‘by’</b> before the new object.</li>
            <li>Change the verb to the past tense.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>In the above example, the word <b>‘digging’</b> has been changed to <b>‘dug’</b>, thus the sentence is now in the passive voice.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-center mt-5">
          <h5 class="pl-3 mb-4"><b>-----------</b></h5>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
            <p>With that, you’ve come to the end of <b>Part 3 of the Ultimate Grammar Guide for PTE</b>.</p>
            <p>I’d now like you to take the quiz below just to reiterate your understanding of Tenses & Parallelism.</p>
