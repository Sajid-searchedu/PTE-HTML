              <p>Once most animals reach adulthood, they stop growing. In contrast, even plants that are thousands of years old continue to grow new needles, add new wood and produce cones and new flowers, almost as if parts of their bodies remained “forever young”. The secrets of plant growth are regions of tissues that can produce cells that later develop into specialized tissues. </p>

              <p>Analysts were impressed by the improvement in margins reported across all regions, apart from the United Kingdom, and said that this reflected a clear effort to improve profitability across the business. Although the turnaround is still in its early stages and the valuation looks full, given the challenge of tuning around such a large and complex business, this is certainly an impressive start.  </p>

Students can make transformations of variables, create graphs of distributions of variables, and select among statistical analyses all at the click of a button. However, even with these advancements, students sometimes still find statistics to be an arduous task.  </p>
