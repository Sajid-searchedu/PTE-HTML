                       <p><b>Who Are Aborigines?</b> Aborigines are Australia's indigenous people. Recent government statistics counted approximately 400,000 aboriginal people, or about 2% of Australia's total population.</p>
                       <p>Australian Aborigines migrated from somewhere in Asia at least 30,000 years ago. Though they comprise 500-600 distinct groups, aboriginal people possess some unifying links. Among these are strong spiritual beliefs that tie them to the land; a tribal culture of storytelling and art; and, like other indigenous populations, a difficult colonial history.</p>
                       <p><b>The Dreamtime:</b> Aboriginal spirituality entails a close relationship between humans and the land. Aborigines call the beginning of the world the "Dreaming" or "Dreamtime". In the "Dreamtime", aboriginal "Ancestors" rose from below the earth to form various parts of nature including animal species, bodies of water, and the sky. Unlike other religions, however, aboriginal belief does not place the human species apart from or on a higher level than nature. Aborigines believe some of the Ancestors metamorphosed into nature (as in rock formations or rivers), where they remain spiritually alive.</p>
                       <p><b>Storytelling, Art, and the Didgeridoo:</b> The oral tradition of storytelling informs aboriginals' vibrant cultural life. Songs illustrate the Dreamtime and other tales of the land, while dances and diagrams drawn in the sand accompany oral tales. In the Northern Territory, aboriginal art includes sculpture, bark and rock paintings, and baskets and beadwork. Rock carvings and paintings can be found in such places as Arnhem Land, Ubirr, and Nourlangie. Many aborigines earn a living through selling native artworks.</p>
                       <p>Aboriginal music is often recognizable for its most famous instrument, the didgeridoo. A wind instrument typically made from bamboo, it extends about five feet and produces a low, vibrating hum. Aborigines use didgeridoos in formal ceremonies at such events as sunsets, circumcisions, and funerals.</p>

                       <p>Adaptations enable living organisms to cope with environmental stresses and pressures. Adaptation can be structural or behavioral. Structural adaptations are special body parts of an organism that help it to survive in its natural habitat (e.g., skin color, shape, body covering). Behavioral adaptations are the ways a particular organism behaves to survive in its natural habitat. Physiological adaptations are systems present in an organism that allow it to perform certain biochemical reactions (e.g. making venom, secreting slime, being able to keep a constant body temperature). Adaptations are traits that have been selected for by natural selection. The underlying genetic basis for the adaptive trait did not arise as a consequence of the environment; the genetic variant pre-existed and was subsequently selected because it provided the bearer of that variant some advantage.</p>

              <p class="mt-5">A charge often leveled against organic agriculture is that it is more philosophy than science. There's some truth to this indictment, if that is what it is, though why organic farmers should feel <input type="text"/> about it is itself a mystery, a relic, perhaps, of our fetishism of science as the only <input type="text"/> tool with which to approach <input type="text"/> nature. The philosophy of natural processes precedes the science of understanding them.</p>

              <p>Evidence for a genetic basis of antisocial behavior stems from several different lines of research. First, behavioral genetic studies of twins and adoptees have demonstrated that <select><option></option><option>parenting </option><option>environment</option><option>heredity</option><option>culture</option></select> plays a role in antisocial behavior, including various forms of aggression and criminality, by finding greater concordance for such behavior in genetically <select><option></option><option>identical</option><option>related</option><option>diverse </option><option>idealized</option></select> individuals, compared to non-relatives living in the same environment. Second, various correlates of antisocial behavior, including personality factors such as impulsivity, sensation-seeking, risk-taking, and callous-unemotional traits, are known to be at least partly genetically <select><option></option><option>delivered</option><option>managed 
</option><option>directed</option><option>influenced</option></select> Third, psychiatric outcomes related to antisocial behavior, including antisocial personality disorder, gambling, and substance use and abuse, have also been <select><option></option><option>inferred</option><option>investigated</option><option>inspected</option><option>integrated </option></select> in genetically informative designs, and each of these has demonstrated significant genetic links.</p>

              <p>Umami was first identified in Japan, in 1908, when Dr. Kikunae Ikeda concluded that kombu, a type of edible seaweed, had a different taste than most foods. He conducted <select><option></option><option>experiences</option><option>contests</option><option>experiments</option><option>attempts </option></select> that found that the high concentration of glutamate in kombu was what made it so tasty. From there, he crystallized monosodium glutamate (MSG), the seasoning that would become <select><option></option><option>spread</option><option>exported</option><option>exclusive</option><option>popular</option></select> the world over. Decades later, umami became scientifically defined as one of the five individual tastes sensed by receptors on the <select><option></option><option>fingers </option><option>mouth</option><option>tongue</option><option>jaws</option></select> Then in 1996, a team of University of Miami researchers studying taste perception made another breakthrough. They discovered separate taste receptor cells in the tongue for detecting umami. Before then, the concept was uncharted. "Up until our research, the <select><option></option><option> predominate</option><option>insignificant</option><option>important</option><option>erroneous</option></select> wisdom in the scientific community was that umami was not a separate sense. It was just a combination of the other four qualities (salty, sweet, bitter, sour)", explained Dr. Stephen Roper, the University of Miami physiology and biophysics professor who helped zero in on the taste along with Nirupa Chaudhari, the team's lead researcher.</p>

              <p>Global climate change is the greatest environmental challenge we face. We have at most a few decades to make the necessary investments to prevent the most serious impacts of climate change. Future generations will judge us based on the investments we are considering now. In its February 2007 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that global emissions must peak no later than 2015 if we are to hold average global temperature increases to 2.4°C (4.3°F) or less. Moving to an emissions pathway that will hold temperature increases to a minimum will require a <select><option></option><option>colossal</option><option>nominal</option><option>negligible</option><option>customary</option></select> effort. There is no time to lose given the long lag in research and development cycles, and energy-intensive <select><option></option><option>agriculture</option><option>architecture</option><option>infrastructure</option><option>conjecture</option></select> and product turnover. Fundamentally, <select><option></option><option>altering </option><option>revoking </option><option>comparing</option><option>analyzing</option></select> the world's energy system is unlikely to occur within this timeframe. It is thus imperative to find means to reduce the footprint of the existing system - most particularly, of coal, which is the most greenhouse gas intensive of the fossil fuels driving climate change. It is in this context that Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) becomes one of the most critical technologies in the menu of choices. It is the only option that provides a potentially near-term solution to rapidly expanding coal use here, in China and around the world. CCS must play the critical role of  <select><option></option><option> sustaining</option><option> curbing</option><option>dividing</option><option>increasing</option></select> growth in emissions  from coal until other alternatives are ready.</p>

              <p>Peering into the future seldom produces a clear picture. But this is not the <select><option></option><option>circumstances</option><option>occurrence</option><option>incidence</option><option>condition </option></select> with bio-energy. Its long-term impacts on the global economy appear to be pretty clear, making many long-term predictions quite compelling, including the demise of the price-setting power of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the end of agricultural protectionism. First, technology is <select><option></option><option>assured</option><option>called</option><option>constrained</option><option>bound</option></select> to deliver a biofuel that will be competitive with fossil energy at something like current prices. It probably already has. Brazil has been exporting ethanol to the US at an average delivery price of $1.45 for an amount with the energy equivalence of a gallon of petrol. It is doing so profitably and in increasing amounts, in spite of a 54 cents a gallon tariff to protect American maize-based ethanol <select><option></option><option>producers</option><option>directors </option><option>programmers</option><option>harvesters</option></select> Many countries are following suit. But ethanol is an inconvenient chemical compound that is corrosive and soluble in water, thus limiting its immediate market to that of a gasoline additive. However, this is just the Betamax phase of the industry. There is plenty of private venture capital money being <select><option></option><option>poured</option><option>emptied</option><option>streamed</option><option>spent</option></select> into finding more efficient ways of extracting energy from biomass and delivering it to transport and power systems. Over time, the technology will also become more flexible, allowing more crops to be used as feedstock, not just the current choice of sugarcane, maize and palm oil. New technologies will be able to extract energy from cellulose, allowing the use of pastures such as switch grass as well as the refuse of current food production.</p>
