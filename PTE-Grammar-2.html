        <h1>Part 4: 10 Most Common Mistakes People Make</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <p>I have checked over 300 practice essays by my students since 2019. After going through them, I can clearly see the similar patterns of mistakes getting repeated again and again.</p>
        <p>In this part of the Ultimate Grammar Guide, I have compiled a list of 10 of the most common mistakes people make when giving their PTE. </p>
        <p>I have also discussed how you can avoid such mistakes.</p>
       </div>

      
      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>1) Using the word ‘The’</b></h5>
        <p>The first most common mistake is using the word ‘the’ wrong.</p>
        <p>Here are the instances where you <b>should</b> use ‘the’.</p>
        <p>We use ‘the’ when only one of something exists in that area, such as the police, the cinema, the hospital, the train station, the airport, etc.</p>
        <p>It is also used when there is only one of something in the entire world. For example, the atmosphere, the sun, the sky, the sea among many others.</p>
        <p>‘The’ can also be used with cardinal numbers, such as the first, the second, the third, the fourth, and so on.</p>
        <p>We can use it with superlatives. Some examples are the best, the worst, the tallest, the shortest, the prettiest, and many more.</p>
        <p>It can be used with names of countries where name refers to a group of states or islands like the USA,the UAE, the UK, and the Middle East.</p>
        <p>It is also used before nouns that describe general actions or activities. For example, “I spent most of my day at <b> the swimming pool</b>” and “We took our cars to <b>the race</b> track.”</p>
        <p>‘The’ is also used before abstract nouns that are describing a process or a situation. It can be used in sentences like this: <b>“The frequency</b> of customers increased after the summer sale.”</p>
        <p>Conversely, we do not use ‘the’ before something that is plural. It is also wrong to use ‘the’ when mentioning a single place like a country or a city.</p>
       </div>

       
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>2) Uncountable Nouns</b></h5>
          <p>Some nouns in English are uncountable. This means that they will always be in their singular form.</p>
          <p>Some of the more common uncountable nouns that students mistake are: advice, advertising, knowledge, food, traffic, entertainment, and happiness.</p>
          <p>If a noun is uncountable, it is wrong to use a plural form of it.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>3) Noun-Verb Agreement</b></h5>
          <p>This is yet another common mistake. The noun and verb must always agree with each other, meaning that if the noun is plural, the verb must be plural as well.</p>
          <p>For example, “There <b>is</b> kids in the playground,” is incorrect, but “There <b> are</b> kids in the playground” is correct.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>4) Gerunds or [to + Infinitive] Verb</b></h5>
          <p>Students are often seen making mistakes when using gerunds and infinitives. They make mistakes in choosing the verbs that follow gerunds and infinitives. </p>
          <p>This has been explained in-depth in previous parts. </p>
       </div> 
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>5) Commas</b></h5>
          <p>When we are writing, we often link ideas. To do this, we use words like, however, nevertheless, moreover, furthermore, in conclusion, and though.</p>
          <p>Whenever these words are used at the beginning of a sentence, we<b> must</b> place a comma after it. </p>
          <p>For example, <b>“In conclusion</b>, it is important to have good Grammar to score better in PTE.”</p>
          <p>There may be instances where you have to place it in the middle of the sentences. When this happens, we<b> must</b> place a comma on both sides of the word.</p>
          <p>Here’s an example, “Regular exercise is key to staying healthy, <b>however</b>, a balanced diet is just as important.”</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>6) Use of Articles before Noun Phrases</b></h5>
          <p>We should include <b> a/an</b> before a combination of adjective and singular noun.</p>
          <p>Such as: an incredible sight, a large house, a delicious steak, etc.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we have to use the word ‘of’ after a noun phrase, for example, a large number of, a small number of, etc.</p>
       </div> 
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="mb-4"><b>7) Verb Tenses</b></h5>
          <p>Using the wrong tenses is yet another common and a major error in PTE.</p>
          <p>Verb tenses have been explained in detail in the previous parts. Using the correct tense is a crucial part of your Grammar so make sure you do them right.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>8) Apostrophes</b></h5>
          <p>Apostrophes are very important. They can change the entire meaning of your sentence if placed incorrectly, so make sure you understand them.</p>
          <p>Apostrophes are used for multiple purposes. They are used to make contractions and shorten words, such as, changing <b>I will</b> to <b>I’ll</b>, or changing <b>should not</b> to <b>shouldn’t</b>. </p>
          <p>Apostrophes can also be used to show possession.</p>
          <p>For example, “We went to the beach in David’<b>s</b> new car.”</p>
       </div> 
       <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class="mb-4"><b>9) Common Spelling Mistakes</b></h5>
          <p>People often make spelling mistakes as well, and while it’s difficult to be perfect, there is a trick to make lesser mistakes.</p>
          <p>The trick is simple, read out loud when rechecking your work. This is simple and extremely effective.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <h5 class=" mb-4"><b>10) Prepositions After Adjectives And Nouns</b></h5>
          <p>This is a problem faced by many students. They often get confused about which preposition to place after the adjective or noun.</p>
          <p><strong>Below are some common prepositions:</strong></p>
          <p><b>At:</b> We use ‘at’ when we are talking about a skill or ability, such as, bad at something, good at something, amazing at something, talented at something.</p>
          <p><b>About:</b> ‘About’ is usually used with adjectives of feeling to explain the cause of them. Happy is a feeling, so you can use ‘about’ to tell that you were happy about the promotion, or perhaps you were nervous about your PTE exam.</p>
          <p><b>With:</b> With is similar to ‘about’ because it too, is used to talk about feelings. However, the difference is that ‘with’ is used when you are referring to a person. Such as, you were happy <b>with</b> the work your employee turned in. Or, you were angry <b>with</b> someone.</p>
          <p><b>In:</b> Some examples of the preposition ‘in’ are, fall in, get in, drop in, rise in, etc.</p>
          <p><b>Of:</b> Some common uses of this preposition are, example of, number of, use of, made of, and many more.</p>
          <p><b>To:</b> This preposition is used to show the connection between two things, such as, He is married <b>to</b> her, I want <b>to</b> tour France, etc.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="text-center mt-5">
          <h5 class="mb-4"><b>---------</b></h5>
       </div>
        <div class="text-left mt-5">
          <p>Congratulations, by now, you have learned – in a simple manner - everything there is about Grammar you need to ace your PTE. </p>
          <p>To reiterate, you do NOT need a perfect Grammar to get 79+ in your PTE. As I teach in <b><u> my Ultimate Guide To Acing PTE online course</u></b>, the most important thing is the structure and smart strategies to do each section of the PTE. </p>
          <p>When I got perfect 90 in PTE, I didn’t have nearly as much command over Grammar as I have today. That is proof that you do not need to be a pro at Grammar.</p>
          <p>However, it doesn’t hurt to learn everything I’ve taught in this Ultimate Grammar Guide so that even if you falter a bit in your structure and the use of smart strategies, you score extra for the Grammar component.</p>
          <p>I hope you will keep this guide with you and use it to ace your PTE exam the next time you take it. </p>
